Multi Objectives Evolutionnary Algorithm - Association rules mining
# Introduction
Gather a huge amount of multi objectives evolutionnary algorithm for solve the association rules mining problem. This library provide state of the art algorithm and tools to compare algorithm performance, futhermore you can choose the metrics which be used for objectives. It's also possible to speed up algorithm by using GPU.
